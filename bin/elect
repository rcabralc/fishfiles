"""Elect.

Usage:
    elect [options] PATTERNS ...

Filter lines from standard input according to one or more patterns, and print
them to standard output.

Results are sorted by length of matched portion (sum for more than one
pattern), followed by length of item.

Depending on the given options, the output may or may not be printed as the
input is read.  If sorting is being done (the default) or some limit is
imposed, then the input will be fully read before processing candidates takes
place.  So, to use this as a stream filter, disable sorting, don't apply a
limit and don't reverse the order of the candidates.

Arguments:
    PATTERNS   The pattern strings (there can be multiple ones).

Options:
    -l LIMIT, --limit=LIMIT
        Limit output up to LIMIT results.  Makes input to be fully read before
        processing.

    --sort-limit=LIMIT
        Sort output only if the number of results is below LIMIT.  Set to zero
        to not sort the output.  Negative numbers are silently ignored, as if
        there were no limit.  There's no default value, so output is always
        sorted by default.

        If this option is not set or is set to a value greater than zero, input
        will be fully read before processing.

        Negative values are interpreted as zero.

    -r, --reverse
        Reverse the returning order of candidates.  Makes input to be fully
        read before processing.

        This is applied after sorting and limiting is done, so this affects
        only the output of the items, not the sorting itself.  If no sorting or
        limiting is done, all candidates are returned in the reversed order of
        input.

    --ignore-bad-patterns
        If a regular expression pattern is not valid, silently ignore it.

    --output-json
        Print lines as JSON objects.

        Each line is a JSON object representing the result of a matching entry
        in the input, containing the following properties:

        value   The raw entry.

        id      The id associated with the entry.

        partitions
                An array of JSON objects, with properties "unmatched" and
                "matched".  By concatenating these properties in this order,
                and concatenating the result of doing the same for each element
                in order, the entry (the value property) is recovered.

        rank    An array of two elements representing the quality of the match.
                Lower numbers are better.  The first number is the sum of
                extents of matched portions of the string of all patterns, and
                the second is the length of the entry.

    --source-command=COMMAND
        Instead of taking items from standard input, take them from the output
        of COMMAND.

        Any '%s' in the COMMAND string is replaced by the raw patterns (in
        order).

        This option, in conjunction with `--source-match-start',
        `--source-match-end' and `--output-json', make this script work as a
        generic normalizing transformer for arbitrary commands.

    --source-match-start=REGEXP
    --source-match-end=REGEXP
        Match start and end of matched portions in source lines accoding to the
        given REGEXPs.

        Usually they should match the escapes \\x1b[31m and \\x1b[9m,
        respectively.  There's no default.

        They should be given together.  If one of them is given and not the
        other, the script terminates with an error code, and no output is
        printed.

        Once they are both given, the script will behave as a normalizing
        transformer on the items of standard input (or whatever is used in
        `--source-command'), and no filtering or sorting is done (all patterns
        are ignored, unless they are being passed to the source command).  If
        `--entry' regular expression is provided, its result is the one used to
        find match starts and ends.

        If `--output-json' is given, the rank property will be [0, 0] for all
        objects, since no sorting or filtering is done.

    --id=REGEXP
        Run input lines through REGEXP in order to extract an id.

        By default, the id of a term is its 1-based line number.  Using ids
        make them trackable from outside.  Ids and entries are emitted in the
        output in the format given in `--output'.

    --entry=REGEXP
        Run input lines through REGEXP in order to extract the entry's value.

        By default, this is the whole line.

    --no-color
        Turn off colored output.

    -h, --help
        Show this.

Patterns:
    The interpretation of the pattern is done according to its initial
    characters (which is not part of the pattern):

        @                   Regular expression.
        =                   Exact match.
        !=                  Exact inverse match.
        !                   Non-exact fuzzy inverse match.
        <anything else>     Fuzzy match.
